## Previewing the theme locally

To preview the theme locally:

1. `cd` into the theme's directory
2. Run `script/bootstrap` to install the necessary dependencies
3. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the preview server
4. Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to preview the theme

## Running tests

The theme contains a minimal test suite, to ensure a site with the theme would build successfully.
To run the tests, simply run `script/cibuild`.
You'll need to run `script/bootstrap` one before the test script will work.
