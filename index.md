## Introduction

My name is **Kasper Sundström** and this is my homepage for the purposes of university courses.

I am an undergraduate student at the **University of Helsinki**, majoring in general linguistics, phonetics and
language technology, and minoring in Nordic languages, Swedish as first language.

I have my own private business, **K. Sundström**, which offers various language-related services, such as translation,
copywriting, copyediting, proofreading, layout, prepress, web design, as well as consulting and training.

I have previously studied commercial law, accounting, and informatics at undergraduate level, and worked in the world
of banking and in the world of non-profit organizations, e.g. as secretary-general of [SSBS sr](https://www.ssbs.fi/)
and [SSI rf](https://stbl.fi/ssi/), publisher of _Studentbladet_.

## Projects

### Fma K. Sundström homepage

For my private business, Fma K. Sundström, I have created a simple homepage, employing the Bootstrap front-end framework.
The page is written in polyglot XHTML5 + SVG + RDFa + ARIA, CSS3, JS, and PHP.
The source code is available on GitHub.

* [GitHub](https://github.com/KSundstrom/fmaksundstrom-homepage)
* [Homepage](https://ksundstrom.fi/)
* (I am particularly proud of the custom [error pages](https://ksundstrom.fi/foo).)

### KoalaOnline

For my choir, the Academic Male Voice Choir of Helsinki, I have created a song-lottery web application,
for use in exams, where a singer is to perform a certain number of random songs in certain categories.
The name _Koala_ is an abbreviation of _Kind-of-a-Lottery App_.
The application employs jQuery Core for functionality, XML and XSD for storing the song information,
and Bootstrap as the front-end framework.
An earlier version used TXT files rather than XML.
Otherwise the application is written in polyglot XHTML5 + SVG + RDFa + ARIA, CSS3, JS, and PHP.
The source code is available on GitHub.

### JKoala

The KoalaOnline web application was originally based on an earlier local Java application.
Its source code is available on GitHub.

* [GitHub](https://github.com/KSundstrom/j-koala)

### cmdline-course

For the purposes of Uni Helsinki course Command-Line Tools for Linguists 2021 I created an exercise repo,
making use of Bash and Python scripts, together with a Makefile, for batch corpus processing.
The corpora consists of Project Gutenberg books.
The source code is available on GitHub (note that the Bash and Python source code is by the course teachers,
not myself.)

* [GitHub](https://github.com/KSundstrom/cmdline-course)

### Other projects

I've written a lot of Microsoft Excel VBA and Microsoft Access SQL over the years, but this code is unfortunately
either proprietary (written for an employer) or written for sensitive personal data, and thus cannot be made publicly
available.

I also enjoy typesetting in LaTeX, using MikTeX locally and Overleaf online for many projects.

## Misc.

I enjoy singing and am a member of the [Academic Male Voice Choir of Helsinki](https://www.akademen.com/) and
[Spira Ensemble](https://spiraensemble.fi/).

I have also been quite active in student nation Åbo Nation.

Whenever I find the time, I try to expand on my family tree in genealogy software Gramps.
